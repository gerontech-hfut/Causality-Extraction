2 22 22 40 41 our data reveal that a maternal sf diet during pregnancy has remarkable effects on an offspring growth traits and intestinal permeability and inflammation , perhaps by modulating the composition and metabolism of gut microbiota.importance although the direct effects of dietary soluble fiber on gut microbiota have been extensively studied , the more indirect effects of maternal nutrition solely during pregnancy on the development of the offspring intestine are until now largely unexplored . 
2 20 22 27 27 stunningly , the contrasting findings of the whi trial of cee alone reported 2 years later - suggesting prevention of coronary heart disease in women who began hrt at age < 60 years , and a reduction in breast cancer overall - were largely ignored .
