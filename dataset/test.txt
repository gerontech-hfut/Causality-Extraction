3 2 2 5 5 in the diabet subgroup , weight , steps , day , low density lipoprotein , and most aspects of hrqol improved significantly . 
3 10 12 17 18 in part , this is due to the fact that β - carotene provides two molecules of vitamin a , while α - carotene provides one upon central cleavage .

3 2 2 10 10 background : hyperuricemia has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and related metabolic abnormalities . 
3 14 16 19 19 most families used rpo and median plasma concentrations of both alpha - carotene and beta - carotene in the children were high . 
3 0 0 12 13 weight reduction is associated with a decrease in the risk of developing cardiovascular disease . 
3 9 9 16 16 background and aims : recent evidence suggests that postprandial hypertriglyceridemia is associated with the incidence of cvd .

3 4 4 10 10 background : there are sex differences in low - grade inflammation markers in obesity - related disorders . 
3 8 8 13 13 conclusion : prolonged exposures to ih during the sleep period induce pronounced vwat inflammation and insulin resistance despite concomitant vwat mass reductions . 
3 5 6 17 17 studies have shown that the gut microbiota is associated with obesity , diabetes , dyslipidemia , and hypertension , which are risk factors for coronary heart disease . 
3 10 11 18 18 it is also not advisable to use subcutaneous administration of vitamin c during gestation and lactation to prevent smoke - and nicotine - related effects on the developing lung , and other strategies should be investigated . 
3 13 15 48 49 it has been shown that within all age groups a difference in usual systolic blood pressure of 20 mm hg or a difference in usual diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm hg is associated with an approximately 2-fold difference in the risk of dying from stroke or ischaemic heart disease .

3 4 4 8 8 background , aims : hyperuricemia is associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome . 
3 5 6 14 14 exposure to traffic - related air pollution is associated with higher placenta , birth weight ratio . 
3 0 0 10 10 sleep disturbance is usually associated with abnormal level of systemic inflammation biomarkers . 
3 1 1 5 5 since hyperuricemia is associated with obesity , renal disease , hyperlipidemia , and atherosclerosis , whether or not serum urate is a cardiovascular risk factor per se has remained elusive . 
3 18 19 24 24 multivariate analyses including age , ht , height , waist circumference , c - reactive protein , and family history of hw identified body weight and hws as the independent predictors of ascending aortic diameter . 
3 7 7 24 24 the present results indicated that 21days of sleep restriction by the platform method induced metabolic syndrome - related alterations that may be mediated by inflammation of the rpat . 
3 5 5 13 13 results : much of the sex difference in arterial elasticity was explained by height . 
3 6 6 14 14 the reversion of the low grade inflammation and the reduction of risk factors in obese individuals seem to occur when a reduction in body mass index is achieved and loss of adipose tissue is observed . 
3 3 4 19 19 greater adherence to mediterranean diet is associated with significant reduction in overall mortality , mortality from cardiovascular diseases and stroke , incidence of or mortality from cancer , and incidence of parkinson disease and alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment . 
3 1 1 44 44 in men , fl and avf ≥ p75 were associated with 3.6 times the risk of hs - crp ≥ 3 mg , l , while in women , these factors were independently and additively associated with a 4.7 times higher risk of systemic inflammation .

3 23 23 49 49 the results of multivariate - adjusted regression analyses indicated that the intake of calcium , plant calcium , potassium , vitamin a , carotene , vitamin b , niacin , vitamin e , vitamin c , and vegetables was associated with significantly reduced risk of osteoporosis after adjusting for age , body mass index , hormone replacement therapy , and energy intake . 
3 9 10 22 22 these differences suggest that the increased risk factors for cardiovascular diseases among the vlbw individuals in adulthood may partly relate to impaired triglyceride metabolism . 
3 4 4 17 17 smoking , diabetes and hypertension were associated separately with low hdl - c and , or high triglyceride . 
3 1 1 10 11 among men with metabolic syndrome , elevated glucose and low hdl cholesterol were most predictive of cvd mortality , followed by elevated bmi , elevated blood pressure , and elevated triglycerides . 
3 22 22 43 43 an improved understanding of adaptive immune cell dysregulation that occurs during obesity and its associated metabolic comorbidities , with an appreciation of sex differences , will be critical for repurposing or developing immunomodulatory therapies to treat obesity and , or t2dm - associated inflammation . 
3 9 9 22 22 conclusion : chronic cmv infection is associated with prevalent frailty , a state with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults , inflammation enhances this effect . 
3 3 4 13 13 factors associated with hiv infection were being < or = 24 years , syphilis positive , used non-water-based liquid as lubricant , and having bleeding gums or oral ulcers during condom - free oral sex . 
3 3 3 23 23 recently , chronic inflammation , associated with oxidative stress , has been proposed to be one of the missing links between atherosclerosis and osteoporosis . 
3 9 9 22 22 thus , changes in levels of serum lipids and lipoproteins in males during adolescence are partly associated with the growth spurt in height .

3 7 7 9 9 for those who have defective clearance of ldl , obesity will accentuate hypercholesterolemia .

3 7 8 28 29 after adjusting for age , sex , family history of diabetes , physical activity and blood pressure , body mass index was positively associated with increased risk of diabetes mellitus . 
3 9 9 18 18 particular caution surrounding lifestyle habits , including drinking and smoking , is warranted in male hypertensive subjects because hypertension at a young age is strongly associated with obesity . 
3 7 7 12 12 these data provide a potential link between selenium deficiency and cardiomyopathy in aids . 
3 21 21 28 29 this case is being reported to highlight the need for a high index of suspicion in diagnosing unusual cases of secondary syphilis , especially in those with concomitant hiv infection . 
3 7 8 19 19 supporting evidence for a causal role of air pollution is provided by studies addressing the regulation of the blood glucose levels in metabolically healthy participants , insulin sensitivity , or pregnancy - related diabetes .

3 10 10 33 35 conclusions : beginning moderately vigorous sports activity , quitting cigarette smoking , maintaining normal blood pressure , and avoiding obesity were separately associated with lower rates of death from all causes and from coronary heart disease among middle - aged and older men . 
3 7 7 17 17 background : previous studies have suggested that hypertension may be associated with increased oxidized low - density lipoprotein . 
3 15 15 20 20 there was a strong , body mass index - independent , association between an , cvd biomarkers and the hyper triglyceride mic waist phenotype . 
3 7 7 16 16 the amount of social activities , cigarette smoking and history of cancers were negatively correlated with ad and their ors were 0.81 , 0.46 and 0.31 respectively .
