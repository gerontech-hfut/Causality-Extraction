1 4 4 13 13 clinically, the excessive ethanol intake accelerates the progression of liver diseases with hbv infection. here, we supposed that ethanol might trigger hbv cccdna in the liver. interestingly, we observed that the ethanol remarkably elevated the levels of hbeag, hbsag, hbv dna and cccdna in hbv-expressing hepatoma cells. mechanically, the ethanol increased the levels of hbx and msl2 in vivo and in hbv-expressing hepg2 cells, but not in hbv-free hepg2 cells. moreover, the down-regulation of msl2 by small interference rna could block the ethanol-promoted hbv cccdna in hepg2.2.15 cells. as a commonly administered treatment for hbv, the effect of ifnα on ethanol-triggered hbv cccdna remains poorly understood. thus, we conclude that ifn-α2b inhibits the ethanol-enriched hbv cccdna through blocking a positive feedback loop of hbx/msl2/cccdna/hbv/hbx. our finding provides new insights into the mechanism by which ifn-α2b inhibits ethanol-enhanced hbv cccdna.

0 10 10 31 31 although these antibody responses were significantly augmented by adding estrogen simultaneously with pwm to mononuclear cell cultures prepared from normal individuals, no such augmentation was demonstrable in cultures from asymptomatic hbv carriers and non-responders to hb vaccine inoculation. these observations suggest that asymptomatic hbv carriers and non-responders to hb vaccine inoculation share a similar deficiency, not found in normal subjects, with regard to the modulatory effects of estrogen..

1 5 5 16 16 we found that the estrogen/androgen signaling pathway is associated with decreased/increased transcription and replication of hbv genes and can promote the development of hbv infections by up/downregulating hbv rna transcription and inflammatory cytokines levels, which in turn slow down the progression of hbv-induced hcc.
1 6 6 8 8 we investigated the effect of estrogen on hbv gene expression and regulation in athymic mice bearing 2.2.15 cells, a human hepatoblastoma cell line derived from hep g-2 transfected with hbv sequences. estrogen treatment suppressed hbv dna expression in males, but had only a minor effect on females. moreover, inhibition of hbv transcription by estrogen was demonstrated by an rna pulse-labelling experiment. these data indicate that estrogen inhibits hbv expression in the in vivo model presented in this study.

0 11 11 15 15 we previously reported that the response of mononuclear cells to estrogen is impaired in hbv carriers, and our present results suggested that this may be due to the low level of estradiol receptors in the cytosol of mononuclear cells..

0 27 27 35 35 differences in distribution of hepatocellular carcinoma incidence are probably due to different levels of exposure to hepatocellular carcinoma risk factors: chronic infections with hepatitis b virus (hbv) and aflatoxin exposure in developing countries, and smoking and alcohol abuse in developed countries.
0 34 34 38 38 for this study, blood samples were collected from hcc patients (n=90) and healthy volunteers (n=99) from xiamen (china) and data for selected environmental risk factors [e.g., benzo[a]pyrene (b[a]p), hepatitis b or c virus (hbv or hcv) infection, smoking and alcohol consumption] were recorded; factors identified as significantly higher (p<0.05) amongst case subjects compared to controls were identified.

0 76 76 82 82 however, the risk of the patients positive for the antigen for hcc was higher in the second period (1:18.7) than in the first period (1:12.8), 2) drinking not only enhanced the risk for hcc 2.7 times, but also accelerated the onset of hcc by about 5 years, 3) blood transfusion enhanced the risk for hcc; hcc occurred in about 20 years on average after blood transfusion in the patients negative for the hepatitis b virus (hbv) and drinking history, and 4) smoking was suggested to be less related to the onset of hcc..
0 4 4 10 10 in addition to hbv infection, cirrhosis, aflatoxins, alcohol, tobacco smoking and oral contraceptives have been evaluated as risk factors for hcc.
0 21 21 31 31 in addition to ageing, chronic inflammation and ongoing immune system dysregulation, other contributing factors are co-infection with potentially oncogenic viruses (hbv, hcv, hpv, ebv) and high-risk behaviours such as tobacco smoking.

0 12 12 44 44 in conclusion, two thirds of hcv carriers and one fourth of hbv carriers in this study population were not aware of their infection status, and awareness of hepatitis infection status was significantly associated with other risk behaviors, such as alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking..

0 7 7 24 24 it is unclear whether low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 11 (lrp11), a newly found lipoprotein receptor regulatory protein, has the carcinogenic effects in cervical cancer..
0 11 11 36 36 here we demonstrate that multiple components of the host high-density lipoprotein (hdl) biogenesis machinery including the lipid effluxers, abca1 and cla 1, and their extracellular lipid acceptor, apoa-1, are recruited to the inclusion of c. trachomatis-infected cells.
2 12 12 20 20 according to the authors the filaments observed in mouse livers are lipoproteins produced by the hepatocytes in response to hbv inoculation.
0 10 10 24 24 analysis of their biochemical and structural properties suggested that lipoprotein lipase (lpl), a key enzyme in lipoprotein metabolism, might interact with pres and hbv particles.
0 18 18 38 38 as shown previously for infection of hepatocytes with hepatitis c virus (hcv), the removal of the cell-bound lipoproteins prior to the addition of the viral inoculum to the cells could also be critical for the uptake of hbv via lipoprotein (ldl)-related receptors.
0 11 11 18 18 fatty liver was positively correlated with triglycerides, cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) and negatively correlated with hbv; thus, hbv had a neutralizing effect on lipid metabolism when coexisting with fatty liver.
0 4 4 19 19 finally, a fusion lipoprotein containing a 16 amino acid epitope from the pre-s2b region of hepatitis b virus (hbv) was presented by an antigen-presenting cell line to a t-cell hybridoma while the corresponding cross-linked s2b peptide was not.
0 8 8 36 36 five lipid metabolism-related genes, the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase, lipoprotein lipase, fatty acid binding protein 4, 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate o-acyltransferase 9, and apolipoprotein a-iv were identified to be significantly activated in hbx transgenic hccs and further validated in human hbv-related hccs.

1 10 10 13 13 here, we investigated the effect of lipase inhibition and lipoprotein uptake on hbv infection using differentiated heparg cells and primary human hepatocytes. we found that an excess of triglyceride rich lipoprotein particles in vitro diminished hbv infection and a reduced hepatic virus uptake in vivo if apolipoprotein e is lacking indicating virus transport along with lipoproteins to target hepatocytes. taken together, our data indicate that hbv connects to the hepatotropic lipoprotein metabolism and that inhibition of cellular hepatic lipase(s) may allow to target early steps of hbv infection..
3 2 2 31 31 high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) levels decrease rapidly during acute conditions of some diseases, and hdl-c levels may be related to mortality in patients with hepatitis b virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (hbv-aclf)..

1 2 2 4 4 whether luteolin inhibits hbv replication has not been validated and the underlying mechanism of which has never been elucidated. in this study, we show that luteolin reduces hbv dna replication in hepg2.2.15 cells. luteolin effectively inhibited the expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (hnf4α) and its binding to the hbv promoters in hepg2.2.15 cells. consistently, blocking erk attenuated the anti-hbv activity of luteolin. in a hbv replication mouse model, luteolin decreased the levels of hbsag, hbeag, hbv dna replication intermediates, and the hbsag and hbcag expression. taken together, our results validated the anti-hbv activity of luteolin in both in vitro and in vivo studies and established a signaling cascade consisting of erk and hnf4α for inhibition of hbv replication by luteolin, which may be exploited for clinical application of luteolin for anti-hbv therapy..
1 6 6 10 10 however, the therapeutic effect of luteolin against lipopolysaccharides (lps)-induced endometritis has not yet been explored. following a successful initiation of the endometritis model by lps, luteolin was intraperitoneally administered three times, at six-hour intervals between each injection in the luteolin groups. conclusively, our findings demonstrated that luteolin effectively alleviated lps-induced endometritis via modulation of tlr4-associated nrf2 and nf-κb signaling pathways..
